# patatap-clone
This is a primitive clone for a website called Patatap. Just for applying my skills purposes.

updated from the website editor to try the pull command

updated from notpad++ on my localhost

now I added this line then I will go to my Git bash on the local machine and try 'git status' (didn't work and just told me I am upto date but when I used 'git pull origin master', it updated my files.)
It must be that 'git status' tracks changes on my local machine only
